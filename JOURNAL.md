This is my journal of the design and building process of **TrlPad**.

## 10/11/2025 - Followed the tutorial  

This marks the start of my macropad. First time doing electronics. Special thanks to nimit and other people in the thread for encouraging me! They also suggested that I needed a deskop app. But for the hardware, the vision would something be like below:

Details: a macropad with 4 keys, rotary encoder and an OLED screen up top. The design inspiration was drawn from effect pedals (it alters sound of a musical instrument, seen them being used by friends and thought it looked cool). 

This isn’t my first time using KiCAD, but it's the first project I’m turning into a real, functioning PCB. Even so, I followed the tutorial from [hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide) to learn from the best, since I’m still a novice.

I had troubles importing the footprint, it didn't detect the imported library automatically. I had to manually select the footprint by double-clicking the component in the schematic editor. After checking with DRC, there appeared to be numerous warnings which I was told by hack-clubbers to ignore apart from the line-height. I patched things up.

I shall begin my actual schematic prototyping in the next journal!

  

## 10/14/2025 - Schematic drafting  

I re-thought the parts I was going to use for this project. It felt that the xiao nrf52840 was more suitable as the guide said it "has wireless capabilities". For some reason again, there were problems with my library imports- I had to install and uninstall, reboot the application a couple times before I could see the footprint.

I spent most of my time researching rotary encoders and the possibility of it being connected with my keyboard matrix. I found some solutions but I am quite puzzled, frankly lost, in their PCB schematics. I made little progress with the project itself as today's work was more researching and asking.

## 10/15/2025 - Polishing schematic + Learning lots  

Continued with research: reading blogs regarding rotary encoder, examining the pcb of the split keyboard guide to figure out where the placements of the 'battery sense' and 'test points' should be, why it's important to use a 4-pin only OLED display etc. 

I also asked around why the Resistor values were the way they were in battery sense, but I didn't get an answer to that. I knew the formula but why was it precisely those?

Eventually everything started to click when I looked after seeing this [repo](https://github.com/bytesizedengineering/macropad?tab=readme-ov-file) and [this one](https://palmacas.com/macroboard-diseno/) which was a link attached to hackpad tutorial (well sort of). I also discovered that the xiao seeed was flipped which explained the blue outline colours in the guide compared to what was previously red on my screen: learnt the shortcut 'F'. The keyboard switches, the resistors and capacitors for the rotary encoder had to be flipped too.

I also learnt the difference between SMD diodes and THT diodes, visually at least -THT really does look more beginner-friendly to solder compared to the former. Another thing, I switched my switch keys footprint to mx (previously being choc) for the intent of it being more tactile.

Not everything is polished yet but I'll amend things soon. Off to another session of learning!  

## 10/16/2025 - Routed the PCB  

I opted for a horizontal oriented macro-pad, leaving behind the initial design in mind (I shall revamp my sketches). This came to realization when finding space for the OLED display. The xiao micro-controller has its USB facing sideways too for convenience. When it's assembled I would be able to connect it without the wires going over my laptop keyboard.

Honestly routing only took so long coz I thought of it as a puzzle (y'know that game where you have to connect pipes and that they shouldn't interfere with another). Until, I discovered that I can route through components (thought I'd mess it up by doing that).  

I also added my fill zones! [This](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide) and Phil's lab's vid on it proved very useful.

Oh shocks...I just realized, are my keypads not facing me?  

## 10/17/2025 - PCB edits + 3D model Research  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjUwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--c9c692039e7c0d5ab4a35d3b0e67269985f9ffad/image.png)

Finally, I fixed the switch keys -it now is on the front copper. Below is the alleged PCB that I worked on for the past couple days:

I then started to think about the design of my macropad. I've searched a YT vid going through the basics of [fusion 360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEIpQHWqPVw&list=PLLm7Yjr9z_z07ohtjFGkA5w-j_NMj8B3J) as a refresher. 

Furthermore, I desire to continue the design of a pedal effect, borrowing its rectangular outline and its steep elevation between the pedal and the rotary encoders (for my design that would be between the screen+rotary encoder and the keypads. Here is a first look of the design:

I know I know there's a lot to work on, but I shall work on this 3d model further
