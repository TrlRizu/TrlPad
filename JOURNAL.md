## 10/11/2025 - Followed the tutorial  

This marks the start of my macropad. First time doing electronics. Special thanks to nimit and other people in the thread for encouraging me! They also suggested that I needed a deskop app. But for the hardware, the vision would something be like below:

Details: a macropad with 4 keys, rotary encoder and an OLED screen up top. The design inspiration was drawn from effect pedals (it alters sound of a musical instrument, seen them being used by friends and thought it looked cool). 

This isn’t my first time using KiCAD, but it's the first project I’m turning into a real, functioning PCB. Even so, I followed the tutorial from [hackpad](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide) to learn from the best, since I’m still a novice.

I had troubles importing the footprint, it didn't detect the imported library automatically. I had to manually select the footprint by double-clicking the component in the schematic editor. After checking with DRC, there appeared to be numerous warnings which I was told by hack-clubbers to ignore apart from the line-height. I patched things up.

I shall begin my actual schematic prototyping in the next journal!

  

## 10/14/2025 - Schematic drafting  

I re-thought the parts I was going to use for this project. It felt that the xiao nrf52840 was more suitable as the guide said it "has wireless capabilities". For some reason again, there were problems with my library imports- I had to install and uninstall, reboot the application a couple times before I could see the footprint.

I spent most of my time researching rotary encoders and the possibility of it being connected with my keyboard matrix. I found some solutions but I am quite puzzled, frankly lost, in their PCB schematics. I made little progress with the project itself as today's work was more researching and asking.
